<h1> Castlegate Clocks </h1>
<h2>Antique Clock Repair and Restoration</h2>

<p>
We offer a full antique clock restoration and clock repair service for clock movements, dials and clock cases. 
</p>
<p>
Our specialist skills enable us to restore and repair a wide range of antique clocks from the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries. We repair and restore all types of clocks, both weight driven and spring driven, striking and non striking, Longcase, bracket or wall clocks, English and continental. 
</p>
<p>
All our work is carried out to a very high standard. Most broken or missing parts for movements are reproduced in our workshop and all our work is guaranteed for a minimum of one year.
</p>
<p>
Clocks for repair can be collected from clients. We will then set the clock back up on return. There is however a charge for this service which is based on distance. 
</p>
<p>
There are always clocks undergoing restoration in our workshop and we will provide details of these and current stock on application.
